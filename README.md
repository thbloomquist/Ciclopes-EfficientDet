This Repository has a custom-trained TensorFlow2 Object Detection Model & three Python Scripts used to run this model's predictions.

This model is trained to detect bowling data, specifically three objects:
1. Bowling Ball
2. Bowling Lane
3. Foul Line

Example usages of each of the Python scripts are contained in comments at the bottom of their files.
